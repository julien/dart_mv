dart mv
==========

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/julien/dart_mv/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/julien/dart_mv/latest)

[Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) Model/View implementation.

A minimalist library that implements a Model and a View class.

A basic example is provided in the "web" directory.

Although the build status is "failing" since about two months,
the tests pass in Dartium.

**TODO**
- Add more tests.
- Generate documentation.
